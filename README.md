### x25519 exchange algorithm

This file contains the implementation of the x25519 key exchange algorithm in Python.

The x25519 algorithm is a key agreement protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. It is based on elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and uses the Curve25519 elliptic curve.
